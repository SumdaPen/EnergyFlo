# Week 4 Notes â€“ Clean Energy Insight App

## What I built
- I finished all the requirements asked including the full pipeline starting from uploading a simplified CSV(compared to the advanced CSV's as the workload will involve work from week 1) all the way to zapier alerts as well as a simple AI analysis that goes with a graph displaying anolomies. I utilized Streamlit, zapier, VS code, and google drive to accomplish the full layout of this project. Everything worked smoothly with the full operation from when the csv is uploaded all the way to the zapier alert being sent if anomolies got detected being 4 minutes max. The hardest part of this project was troubleshooting the code to identify the anomolies and figuring how to configure zaps to properly analyze the data in the sheets. What didn't work well was how long the zapier alert took to send, which could be improved. Another thing was the CSV uploaded had to be a simplified version with only 2 columns, as a real-world energy CSV would take extra code and time (didn't know if we should travel back to week one) to properly scrape through and capture the real data.

## Next steps
- Use chatGPT API key to summarize and generate much better summaries, taking in more inputs as well as real-world updates
- Add login factor and make zapier send mroe specified emails much faster
